This contains various apps that pertain to the C# project folder.
Some of the projects include:  a loop that is stopped from continuing infinitely, a loop that can get certain ages from a list and print them as programmed, a loop that can pinpoint the position of an item in a list and can tell whether or not there are duplicates of that item or not, 
and a loop that can find if there is a duplicate in two lists and point it out.
